     There is often confusion about when it is appropriate to use IDs and when Classes should be used instead. This blog is geared to display the differences.
    </p>
    <p>
       One thing that must be known is that ID'sare unique, where as Classes can be applied to many things.  In general, use ID whenever you want to refer to a specific element and Class when you have a number of things that are all alike. For instance, common ID elements are things like header, footer, sidebar. Common Class elements are things like highlight or external-link.
    </p>
    <p>
       The most basic precedence you should understand of these two, however, is that ID selectors take priority over class selectors. If you had something like this:
       <br>
       <br>(p id="header" class ="intro"> Hi there!(/p)
        <br>
        and:
        <br>
        #header {color:black}
        .intro{ color:yellow}
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Even though both the Class and ID change the paragraph's color, the color would be black because the Class has priority over the ID.
