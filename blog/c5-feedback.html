      One of my favorite experiences so far in DBC has been peer pairing. I love the concept of working with other people who are just as excited and passionate about solving these problems and trying to learn more! It's really cool to see how other people not only work but what you can learn from eachother as well. I've learned so much more from every pairing session not only from what my partner has told me but I also I believe you truly don't understand something until you can teach it. So it personally helps you in both ways
    </p>
    <p>
      So far in this experience it's really only been a month but it feels like so much more! We've gone through so much in little time but even before this I've always been the type to keep going at any kind of problem or challenge until I complete it or understand it but what I like about pairing is all the partners I've had so far, have had the same mentality. So having someone there next to you just as drive or even more pushes you even more. It becomes a competition where only both partners can benefit because it brings out the best in both people. 
      </p>
      <p> 
         But not only is pairing really important, getting feedback is right up there. Reason being you can think you did great sometimes or maybe not but if you have a partner who can give you good, precise, and constructive feedback is only going to help you. So far from the feedback that I've received people have told me they enjoyed having me as a partner and that i had some great ideas on different situations but my favorite part is reading on where they tell me I can be better because those are things that we might not notice in ourselves. 
       </p>
       <p> So what I've learned from pairing and getting feedback is it really helps and I'd only encourage other people to try this system no matter what field.
