     I feel like we all go or have experienced some kind of steroe types in our lives. Regardless if it's a gender, sexual, racial, etc. But one I'd like to talk about is my most recent and new form of steroetype that I've been a part of.
    </p>
    <p> I grew up in Los Angeles, Ca and moved to Riverside, Ca when I was 15. I've never really left Southern California but being interested and involved in the tech industry you always hear about Silicon Valley and all the huge changes in San Francisco but I've never seen it for myself. This weekend I came to San Francisco to look for housing and got to meet a lot of really cool and amazing people but sadly not all of them thought the same about me and it wasn't because of anything I said or did but it was just because I was a "Developer".
    </p>
    I personally love how rapid this field is growing but it does have it's down sides. One thing I've learned since being here is San Fran has gone up in rent 700% in the last 5 years! A lot of people have been forced out of their homes because rent has been shooting up because the tech field is really blowing up. I'm seeing that more businesses are growing than homes and people seem to be blaming these "developers". I've seen a lot of hate towards this field because of all that from the locals and they have tried to discourage me from continuing. 
  </p>
  <p>
    All I have to say is that is NOT the reason why I came into this field so why am I being blamed for that? I love what I'm learning and I'm not going to let anyone give me a guilt trip over stuff other people have done and I wouldn't want anyone else to get discouraged or slowed down because of this. Ultimately we all have the right to do what we want and get to choose what we want to do with the knowledge. I hope no one takes that responsibility lightly but it is our choice just like everyone else outside the field.
