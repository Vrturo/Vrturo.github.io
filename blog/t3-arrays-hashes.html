     So this week's blog I want to go over two different things I learned in DBC at the end of my first unit in phase 0. There's these two cool things called Arrays and Hashes. I'll start of by first describing what each do. Well first off, an array is a sorted list of values that you can put in a single variable. Arrays also have something to help call on the values in the array called an index. The first element that index 0, the next gets index 1, the one after that gets index 2, and so on.
     And we can access elements of the array directly through these numbers. For example:<br>
     <br>
     array = [1, 2, 3] array[1]<br><br>
     The array will return 2 not 1 because the index of 1 is 0, the 2 is 1, and 3 is 2.
</p>
    <p>
     So now we know that arrays are indexed with numbers that start with 0 and go up to the array's length minus one. But what if we want to use numeric indices that don't go in order from 0 to the end of the array? What if we don't want to use numbers as indices at all? We'll need a new array structure called a hash. So next we have a hash. So a hash is a collection of unique keys that you input. They can also be called associative arrays. But it is not the same as an array. An array can only input values from integers and hashes you can input any type of objects. Hash syntax looks like this: <br>
<br>
hash = { key1 => value1, key2 => value2, key3 => value3 }<br>
<br>
Values are assigned to keys using =>. You can use any Ruby object for a key or value.
