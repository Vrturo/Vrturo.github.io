    When I think of the times in my life where Iâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, the following values come to mind. 
    <ul>
    <p>Excitement
    <br>Ambition
    <br>Confidence
    <br>Achievement
    <br>Helping others
    <br>Leadership
    <br>Credibility
    
       <br><br>In general, I really do feel like I try my hardest to live up to these values and I really feel like it's shown with the people around me. 
    </p>
    <p> The last time I gave someone advice was to a friend of mine. He is currently going to school and just wasn't happy. I feel as if this relates to the values I chose because if youre not excited or happy in what you're doing or where you're headed then what's the point. I feel as if I'm doing something and it includes these values I'll always be happy.
    </p>
    <p> I feel really passionate about my values because I believe if I truly want to be hapy and be able to achieve everything I want in life for myself and my family I have to follow them. In my blog about stereo type threat I wrote about being discriminated for being labeled as a "developer" meaning I'm only doing this for the money and I don't care about anything else but if I live up to these values it's the complete opposite!
