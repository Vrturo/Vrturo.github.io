     This blog I'll be talking about Classes in Ruby. When you start solving larger problems organization is key. You don't want 100 different methods and variables that do overlapping things. If you're trying to keep track of data you you can recycle methods and only need to update that data in one place at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you design a class, think about the objects that will be created from that class type. Think about the things the object knows and the things the object does. Things an object knows about itself are called instance variables. They represent an object's state and can have unique values for each object of that type. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example I will define a Class named dog and where it will take the methods that can make it bark and also display it's breed and name.
