     When it comes to Ruby programming there are a lot of different variables. This week's blog I want to go over Ruby's different syntax denoting its accessibiity, or scope. These differences are real important and make a huge difference.
    </p>
     <p>
      <br>local_var<br>
        Local variables are local to the code construct in which they are declared. For example, a local variable declared in a method or within a loop cannot be accessed outside of that loop or method. Local variable names must begin with either an underscore or a lower case letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>CONSTANT<br>
      Ruby constants are values which, once assigned a value, should not be changed. Ruby differs from most programming languages in that it allows a constant value to be changed after it has been declared, although the interpreter will protest slightly with a warning message. Constants declared within a class or module are available anywhere within the context of that class or module. Constants declared outside of a class or module are assigned global scope.
      </p>
      <p>
      <br>@@class_var<br>
      A class variable is a variable that is shared amongst all instances of a class. This means that only one variable value exists for all objects instantiated from this class. This means that if one object instance changes the value of the variable, that new value will essentially change for all other object instances. Another way of thinking of thinking of class variables is as global variables within the context of a single class. Class variables are declared by prefixing the variable name with two @ characters (@@). Class variables must be initialized at creation time.
    </p>
    </p>
      <br>@instance_var<br>
      Instance variables are similar to Class variables except that their values are local to specific instances of an object. Other objects of the same class have their own local copies of the variable which are independent of changes made in any other objects. Instance variables are declared in Ruby by prefixing the variable name with a single @ sign.
      </p>
    <p>
      <br>$global_var<br>
     Global variables in Ruby are accessible from anywhere in the Ruby program, regardless of where they are declared. Global variable names are prefixed with a dollar sign ($).
