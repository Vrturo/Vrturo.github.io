	<h2>How do computers work?</h2>
	<p>If you're looking for a basic understanding on how computers work, you need to understand 3 key things: hardware, software, and input.
	</p>
	<h3>Hardware</h3> <img src="http://img.tomshardware.com/us/2005/06/14/home_theater_pcs/d-vine-hardware.jpg">
	<p>
	Hardware consists of devices, like the computer itself, the monitor, keyboard, printer, mouse and speakers. Inside your computer there are more bits of hardware, including the motherboard, where you would find the main processing chips that make up the central processing unit (CPU). The hardware processes the commands it receives from the software, and performs tasks or calculations.
</p>
	<h3>Software</h3><img src="http://www.valueautomation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fotolia_51260619_XS.jpg">
<p>
	Software is the name given to the programs that you install on the computer to perform certain types of activities. There is operating system software, such as the Apple OS for a Macintosh, or Windows 95 or Windows 98 for a PC. There is also application software, like the games we play or the tools we use to compose letters or do math problems.
</p>
	<h3>Input</h3> <img src="http://indiatyping.com/images/indiatyping/india%20typing.jpg">
<p>
	You provide the input. When you type a command or click on an icon, you are telling the computer what to do. That is called input.<hr>
</p>
<p>
	So after understanding these key things it's important you understand how they work together. 
</p>
<p>
	First, you provide input when you turn on the computer. Then the system software tells the CPU to start up certain programs and to turn on some hardware devices so that they are ready for more input from you. This whole process is called booting up.
</p>
<p>
	The next step happens when you choose a program you want to use. You click on the icon or enter a command to start the program. Let's use the example of an Internet browser. Once the program has started, it is ready for your instructions. You either enter an address (called a URL, which stands for Uniform Resource Locator), or click on an address you've saved already. In either case, the computer now knows what you want it to do. The browser software then goes out to find that address, starting up other hardware devices, such as a modem, when it needs them. If it is able to find the correct address, the browser will then tell your computer to send the information from the web page over the phone wire or cable to your computer. Eventually, you see the web site you were looking for.
