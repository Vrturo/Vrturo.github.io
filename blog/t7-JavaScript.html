	<h1>Ruby vs JavaScript</h1>
	<p> 
		In this Blog I wanted to go over the main differences I see in Ruby and Javascript functions. The structure can be similar but they are very different languages. Functions in JavaScript are the same as methods in Ruby. The syntax of declaring a function vs. declaring a method is slightly different
	</p>
		<table cellspacing="30" align="center">
			<tr>
				<th><h3>Ruby</h3></th>
				<th><h3>JavaScript</h3></th>
			</tr>
			<tr><td> def plus_10(num = 0)<br>
					 num + 10<br>
					 end<br>
					 <br>
					 plus_10 =>	 #10<br>
					 plus_10(5) => #15
				</td>
				<td> function plus_10(num)<br>
					 {return (num) || 0) + 10; }<br>
					 <br>
					 <br>
					 plus_10();    // 10<br>				
				     plus_10(5);    // 15<br>
				</td>
			<tr>
				<td>In Ruby you define a method using the def function. You can give a method an argument and set the argument value so you can start adding to it. 
				</td>
				<td> In JavaScript you define a function by using function. You can give functions arguments as well. In order for you to return the value you have to use the return method and have it return whatever value you give it as true using the ||.
