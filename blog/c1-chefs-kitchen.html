      Hello! So my name is Arturo Perez and I'm just starting out on my Web Developer Career thanks to a GREAT program out based off San Francisco,CA called Dev Bootcamp! So far my impression of DBC is that if you truly like to code it's gonna be a FUN experience! This program seems pretty fast paced and it is a lot of information but what I love is i have all the help in the world, and not just from instructors. New students and alumnis jump in to help as well and so far, even though it's only been a week in, it's been a great experience and I can only imagine how much better it's gonna be.
    </p>
    <p>
        So in this blog I want to approach two different mindset's you can have in DBC. First, there is the Restaurant Mindset. With this mindset you would look at DBC like something you specifically paid for and have a set expectation, like ordering food at a restaurant. If DBC were a restaurant, the menu would be like learning different types of code. So since you paid you expect your food to be at a certain quality and taste. So students coming in can have that mindset and be visioning that they are going to come in and leave knowing code to the best of their ability. It's a confident mindset.
    </p>
    <p>
        And now theres a kitchen mindset. A kitchen mindset is basically looked as working together to achieve the same goal. So looking back into the restauraunt example this isn't the consumer's point of view its the back end.  Picture some chefs, or students in this example, in the kitchen that might know more recipes, or code than others. And others could be barely starting off. Like if it's their first day working, or someone who is new to coding. But what makes this mindset so effective is that everyone is working together to achieve the same goal. 
    </p>
    <p> They both have great qualities to their mindset but no matter what, I feel it's important to look at each mindset and remember sometimes you won't get exactly what you ordered. Or sometimes you're just having a bad day at work. But what's important as long as you can get pas those days and fight through it, you can find success.
