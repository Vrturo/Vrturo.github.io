     This week as part of my Cultural Blog I was asked to address an issue a current day tech issue. If you ask me, there's many. Maybe a lack of privacy with all this new technology going on? Maybe this new technology is taking away from manual labor jobs? Or what about cyber bullying? These are all big problems in the field but today I chose to write about something I've seen but also experiencing and thats a lack of minorities in the tech field.  </p>
    <p>
      After years of playing down the problem, technology companies like Google, Facebook and Apple finally say theyâ€™re serious about improving the gender and ethnic diversity of their work forces and corporate boards. Recent data from those companies and others like them confirm what everyone has long known: Most of their employees are white and Asian men. Among technical employees, few are women, and even fewer are Latino or African-American. As being part of a minority group I see this as a huge problem.

</p>
<p>
      The good thing is there are solutions that can help increase these numbers because tech companies SHOULD care about these numbers. Many studies show that companies with gender and ethnic diversity tend to be more creative and more profitable, because varied perspectives help them design products and services that appeal to a diverse, worldwide audience.

      There are a lot of things that can be done but I feel like creating a welcoming culture, which is often easier said than done, would help these companies retain employees who get in the door. A 2011 report by the Census Bureau found that women science and engineering graduates were much less likely to be employed in those fields than men with the same degrees. A 2008 report published by the Harvard Business Review found that women quit high tech jobs at twice the rate of men. Among the most frequently cited reasons women gave for leaving, it said, were extreme pressure and a hostile culture.
