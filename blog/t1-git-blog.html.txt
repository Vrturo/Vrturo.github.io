  <h1>Version Control, Git, GitHub, and YOU!</h1>

      So this week I'm writing this blog to explain 3 main topics
      
      What are the benefits of version control?
      How does git help you keep track of changes?
      Why use GitHub to store your code?


    </p>
    <p>
       First off, if you don't know what Version Control is, let me explain. Version control is a system that allows developers to track changes made on their code files throughout the lifetime of a project. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So there are many programs that this system, specifically Git. The program Git is designed such that it views your code files like a “tree” and allows you to do cool things like create a “branch” where you work on some of the files without affecting the “trunk” code base until you are sufficiently convinced that the changes you are making are good and won’t break the rest of the tree. If you are alone working on a project or even in a group git is a great way to track the changes you or anyone else makes and also safeguards yourself and others from making silly mistakes that breaks your web app or, worse yet, accidentally delete months of work. 
    </p>
<p>     
      Lastly, the way Github helps with version Control is by letting you upload your work on an online site where not only you can go on, from any computer that has internet access and go ahead and view and edit files but anyone else can do the same and it will all be tracked and logged on there.
