     I feel like coming from a traditional Mexican family it's really easy for parents to see their child going to a college or a university as their answer for you to make a living. Sometimes they can act like that's the ONLY answer. I know I've had my share of conflicts with my parents on this subject. When I finally realized I was only going to college because of my parents and not because it was something I truly wanted to do, I dropped out. The news hit my parents really hard as if I had given up on my future. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The day I told my parents I wasn't going back to school they felt so let down. They said everything they've done at this point in their life was to set me and my siblings up to go to school, especially considering the fact that my oldest sister graduated from a university and it worked out really well for her. It upsets me because they're so close minded on what is really going on now a days but I can't blame them for their lack of knowledge seeing how they're barely learning how to text. 
    </p>

      I felt as if the only way I could redeem myself with them was if I hit the goal they wanted for me without a degree. I made them realize that it wasn't the degree that they wanted me to get, it was the a career or some sort of long term financial stability. So I showed them I wasn't dropping out to just to be at home but to put my attention towards other things that can get me there a lot faster. I made a game plan and I showed them how I was going to put it to action. Their minds definitely changed after they saw how excited and motivated I was.
    </p>
    <p> Only thing I'd change from this experience is not dropping out sooner. Or even starting school at all. I see it was a waste of time for me because I was doing something I didnt want to do because other people wanted me to do. I learned that if I focus too much on just making other people happy no matter who it is, it won't necessarily mean I'll be happy.
