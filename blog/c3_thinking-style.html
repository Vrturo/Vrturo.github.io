 <p> So now I'm in week 3 of phase 0 in Dev BootCamp. At the beggining of this program I took a <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Personal Thinking Style</a> test. I tested half Concrete Random Thinker and the other half Abstract Random Thinker. Based on this information it's telling me I'm a random thinker and I love the world of theory and abstract thought and I completely agree! 
</p>
<p>   The biggest struggle so far in these 3 weeks has been fully graspin a programming language called Ruby. I really don't find it to difficult but I just can't fully grasp why certain functions do certain things or why there are certain errors sometimes, but that's where the practice takes play. I feel like I might be struggling in Ruby more than html or css because I get to use my creative thought and imagination on those and it makes it a lot more fun where as ruby seems really direct. But one thing is for sure, If I just keep putting more time in and practicing I will get it down.
</p>
<p>
       Now there's another subject I want to clear, and thats Growth vs. Fixed mindset. People in a fixed mindset believe you either are or aren’t good at something, based on your inherent nature, because it’s just who you are. People in a growth mindset believe anyone can be good at anything, because your abilities are entirely due to your actions. I believe the growth mindset is a great way to look at things because if you believe, “You’re either naturally great or will never be great,” then when you have any trouble, your mind thinks, “See? You’ll never be great at this. Give up now.” But the growth mindset believes trouble is just important feedback in the learning process. So now knowing this I'm entering Dev Boocamp with a fixed mindset knowing that it won't be easy but I'm embracing the challenge, know i have to put effort into this mastery, and learn from citicism whether good or bad.
